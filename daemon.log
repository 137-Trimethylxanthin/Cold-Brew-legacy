[00:14.77] Olha, puta que pariu
[00:16.40] Primeiro eu passei na 13
[00:17.94] Que é o baile do Brasil
[00:19.70] Eu fui lá pro Jacaré
[00:20.82] Que é o baile de Paris

[00:25.63] Two mo' hoes, bitches cold
[00:27.41] Look, I'm on a roll, .22 magnum water hole
[00:30.33] Aim it close, it's on yo' nose
[00:31.96] It ain't even loaded, I just like to see you scared
[00:34.81] I'm the one to come up to your house and raise your body hair
[00:37.92] What you want from me? The double D, I'll cut you once and let you sleep
[00:41.63] Get so high, I'm 'bout to peak, damn, you love it, lil' freak
[00:44.75] Scopin' in the night, I can barely see a thing
[00:47.62] And I trust my gut to let it buckle, shit, I killed the king
[00:50.87] In the spring I will bury you, sing this song, I'll carry you
[00:54.20] To your grave, no one can save the softest, son, I look so gray
[00:57.49] People can't remember what you even look like
[01:00.36] You've been gone, gone for way too long
[01:02.28] Deep inside your neighbors' lawn
[01:03.90] Cold case, what a waste
[01:05.36] "C'mon Freddie, have some taste"
[01:06.94] Never, bitch, I do my thing
[01:08.55] I just wanna see you hang
[01:10.34] Runnin' outta anger, I just got to get my fix
[01:13.05] Think I'm nice? Well, what a twist
[01:14.89] Then I go off in the mist
[01:16.85] Eu viajei o mundo todo
[01:18.71] Olha, puta que pariu
[01:20.37] Primeiro eu passei na 13

[00:25.63] Two mo' hoes, bitches cold
[00:27.41] Look, I'm on a roll, .22 magnum water hole
[00:30.33] Aim it close, it's on yo' nose
[00:31.96] It ain't even loaded, I just like to see you scared
[00:34.81] I'm the one to come up to your house and raise your body hair
[00:37.92] What you want from me? The double D, I'll cut you once and let you sleep
[00:41.63] Get so high, I'm 'bout to peak, damn, you love it, lil' freak
[00:44.75] Scopin' in the night, I can barely see a thing
[00:47.62] And I trust my gut to let it buckle, shit, I killed the king
[00:50.87] In the spring I will bury you, sing this song, I'll carry you
[00:54.20] To your grave, no one can save the softest, son, I look so gray
[00:57.49] People can't remember what you even look like
[01:00.36] You've been gone, gone for way too long
[01:02.28] Deep inside your neighbors' lawn
[01:03.90] Cold case, what a waste
[01:05.36] "C'mon Freddie, have some taste"
[01:06.94] Never, bitch, I do my thing
[01:08.55] I just wanna see you hang
[01:10.34] Runnin' outta anger, I just got to get my fix
[01:13.05] Think I'm nice? Well, what a twist
[01:14.89] Then I go off in the mist
[01:16.85] Eu viajei o mundo todo
[01:18.71] Olha, puta que pariu

[00:16.40] Bitch you know I am the murderous tool
[00:18.34] Freddie gon' kill you right out of his tomb
[00:20.14] Chokin' you out and you hear the big boom
[00:21.86] Devilish shit, choke on a bitch
[00:23.69] Breakin' the skin and finessin' the hit
[00:25.58] Eyes in the back of my head
[00:27.00] Better they dead
[00:27.99] People they call me the Dredd
[00:29.46] I am the darkness, you are a carcass
[00:31.14] Feeding the evil with people like dreams
[00:33.09] Looking straight up and you see the big beam
[00:34.80] Come on and test me I'll kill your whole team
[00:36.53] Ten whole shots to your brain
[00:38.00] Aim it like a gang
[00:38.96] Better cock it back, let it bang
[00:40.29] Bitch you want smoke or the flame?
[00:41.67] Bitch you are a lame
[00:42.79] Bitch you stay out of my lane
[00:44.24] I'mma get dope smokin' deuce
[00:45.90] And if a bitch is crazy I'mma put her on the loose
[00:47.71] Murder shit every day, gotta go away
[00:49.49] Gotta take my time, gotta let Tai-Pei
[00:51.41] I'mma get dope smokin' deuce

[00:16.40] Primeiro eu passei na 13
[00:17.94] Que é o baile do Brasil
[00:19.70] Eu fui lá pro Jacaré

[00:25.63] Two mo' hoes, bitches cold
[00:27.41] Look, I'm on a roll, .22 magnum water hole
[00:30.33] Aim it close, it's on yo' nose
[00:31.96] It ain't even loaded, I just like to see you scared
[00:34.81] I'm the one to come up to your house and raise your body hair
[00:37.92] What you want from me? The double D, I'll cut you once and let you sleep
[00:41.63] Get so high, I'm 'bout to peak, damn, you love it, lil' freak
[00:44.75] Scopin' in the night, I can barely see a thing
[00:47.62] And I trust my gut to let it buckle, shit, I killed the king
[00:50.87] In the spring I will bury you, sing this song, I'll carry you
[00:54.20] To your grave, no one can save the softest, son, I look so gray
[00:57.49] People can't remember what you even look like
[01:00.36] You've been gone, gone for way too long
[01:02.28] Deep inside your neighbors' lawn
[01:03.90] Cold case, what a waste
[01:05.36] "C'mon Freddie, have some taste"
[01:06.94] Never, bitch, I do my thing
[01:08.55] I just wanna see you hang
[01:10.34] Runnin' outta anger, I just got to get my fix
[01:13.05] Think I'm nice? Well, what a twist
[01:14.89] Then I go off in the mist
[01:16.85] Eu viajei o mundo todo
[01:18.71] Olha, puta que pariu
[01:20.37] Primeiro eu passei na 13

lyrics: [00:14.45] Killin' the masses, killin' the fool
[00:16.40] Bitch you know I am the murderous tool
[00:18.34] Freddie gon' kill you right out of his tomb
[00:20.14] Chokin' you out and you hear the big boom
[00:21.86] Devilish shit, choke on a bitch
[00:23.69] Breakin' the skin and finessin' the hit
[00:25.58] Eyes in the back of my head
[00:27.00] Better they dead
[00:27.99] People they call me the Dredd
[00:29.46] I am the darkness, you are a carcass
[00:31.14] Feeding the evil with people like dreams
[00:33.09] Looking straight up and you see the big beam
[00:34.80] Come on and test me I'll kill your whole team
[00:36.53] Ten whole shots to your brain
[00:38.00] Aim it like a gang
[00:38.96] Better cock it back, let it bang
[00:40.29] Bitch you want smoke or the flame?
[00:41.67] Bitch you are a lame
[00:42.79] Bitch you stay out of my lane
[00:44.24] I'mma get dope smokin' deuce
[00:45.90] And if a bitch is crazy I'mma put her on the loose
[00:47.71] Murder shit every day, gotta go away
[00:49.49] Gotta take my time, gotta let Tai-Pei
[00:51.41] I'mma get dope smokin' deuce
[00:53.62] You can see me sippin' on the Goose
[00:55.50] Head laid back, let it loose
[00:57.43] Bitch you know it's alcohol abuse
[00:59.05] I'mma get dope smokin' deuce
[01:00.90] You can see me sippin' on the Goose

lyrics: [00:12.70] Eu viajei o mundo todo
[00:14.77] Olha, puta que pariu
[00:16.40] Primeiro eu passei na 13
[00:17.94] Que é o baile do Brasil
[00:19.70] Eu fui lá pro Jacaré
[00:20.82] Que é o baile de Paris

[00:25.63] Two mo' hoes, bitches cold
[00:27.41] Look, I'm on a roll, .22 magnum water hole
[00:30.33] Aim it close, it's on yo' nose
[00:31.96] It ain't even loaded, I just like to see you scared
[00:34.81] I'm the one to come up to your house and raise your body hair
[00:37.92] What you want from me? The double D, I'll cut you once and let you sleep
[00:41.63] Get so high, I'm 'bout to peak, damn, you love it, lil' freak
[00:44.75] Scopin' in the night, I can barely see a thing
[00:47.62] And I trust my gut to let it buckle, shit, I killed the king
[00:50.87] In the spring I will bury you, sing this song, I'll carry you
[00:54.20] To your grave, no one can save the softest, son, I look so gray
[00:57.49] People can't remember what you even look like
[01:00.36] You've been gone, gone for way too long
[01:02.28] Deep inside your neighbors' lawn
[01:03.90] Cold case, what a waste
[01:05.36] "C'mon Freddie, have some taste"
[01:06.94] Never, bitch, I do my thing
[01:08.55] I just wanna see you hang
[01:10.34] Runnin' outta anger, I just got to get my fix
[01:13.05] Think I'm nice? Well, what a twist
[01:14.89] Then I go off in the mist
[01:16.85] Eu viajei o mundo todo
[01:18.71] Olha, puta que pariu

[00:16.40] Primeiro eu passei na 13
[00:17.94] Que é o baile do Brasil
[00:19.70] Eu fui lá pro Jacaré

[00:25.63] Two mo' hoes, bitches cold
[00:27.41] Look, I'm on a roll, .22 magnum water hole
[00:30.33] Aim it close, it's on yo' nose
[00:31.96] It ain't even loaded, I just like to see you scared
[00:34.81] I'm the one to come up to your house and raise your body hair
[00:37.92] What you want from me? The double D, I'll cut you once and let you sleep
[00:41.63] Get so high, I'm 'bout to peak, damn, you love it, lil' freak
[00:44.75] Scopin' in the night, I can barely see a thing
[00:47.62] And I trust my gut to let it buckle, shit, I killed the king
[00:50.87] In the spring I will bury you, sing this song, I'll carry you
[00:54.20] To your grave, no one can save the softest, son, I look so gray
[00:57.49] People can't remember what you even look like
[01:00.36] You've been gone, gone for way too long
[01:02.28] Deep inside your neighbors' lawn
[01:03.90] Cold case, what a waste
[01:05.36] "C'mon Freddie, have some taste"
[01:06.94] Never, bitch, I do my thing
[01:08.55] I just wanna see you hang
[01:10.34] Runnin' outta anger, I just got to get my fix
[01:13.05] Think I'm nice? Well, what a twist
[01:14.89] Then I go off in the mist
[01:16.85] Eu viajei o mundo todo

[00:30.33] Aim it close, it's on yo' nose
[00:31.96] It ain't even loaded, I just like to see you scared
[00:34.81] I'm the one to come up to your house and raise your body hair
[00:37.92] What you want from me? The double D, I'll cut you once and let you sleep
[00:41.63] Get so high, I'm 'bout to peak, damn, you love it, lil' freak
[00:44.75] Scopin' in the night, I can barely see a thing
[00:47.62] And I trust my gut to let it buckle, shit, I killed the king
[00:50.87] In the spring I will bury you, sing this song, I'll carry you
[00:54.20] To your grave, no one can save the softest, son, I look so gray
[00:57.49] People can't remember what you even look like
[01:00.36] You've been gone, gone for way too long
[01:02.28] Deep inside your neighbors' lawn
[01:03.90] Cold case, what a waste
[01:05.36] "C'mon Freddie, have some taste"
[01:06.94] Never, bitch, I do my thing
[01:08.55] I just wanna see you hang
[01:10.34] Runnin' outta anger, I just got to get my fix
[01:13.05] Think I'm nice? Well, what a twist
[01:14.89] Then I go off in the mist
[01:16.85] Eu viajei o mundo todo

[00:16.40] Bitch you know I am the murderous tool
[00:18.34] Freddie gon' kill you right out of his tomb
[00:20.14] Chokin' you out and you hear the big boom
[00:21.86] Devilish shit, choke on a bitch
[00:23.69] Breakin' the skin and finessin' the hit
[00:25.58] Eyes in the back of my head
[00:27.00] Better they dead
[00:27.99] People they call me the Dredd
[00:29.46] I am the darkness, you are a carcass
[00:31.14] Feeding the evil with people like dreams
[00:33.09] Looking straight up and you see the big beam
[00:34.80] Come on and test me I'll kill your whole team
[00:36.53] Ten whole shots to your brain
[00:38.00] Aim it like a gang
[00:38.96] Better cock it back, let it bang
[00:40.29] Bitch you want smoke or the flame?

[00:16.40] Primeiro eu passei na 13
[00:17.94] Que é o baile do Brasil
[00:19.70] Eu fui lá pro Jacaré

[00:25.63] Two mo' hoes, bitches cold
[00:27.41] Look, I'm on a roll, .22 magnum water hole
[00:30.33] Aim it close, it's on yo' nose
[00:31.96] It ain't even loaded, I just like to see you scared
[00:34.81] I'm the one to come up to your house and raise your body hair
[00:37.92] What you want from me? The double D, I'll cut you once and let you sleep
[00:41.63] Get so high, I'm 'bout to peak, damn, you love it, lil' freak
[00:44.75] Scopin' in the night, I can barely see a thing
[00:47.62] And I trust my gut to let it buckle, shit, I killed the king
[00:50.87] In the spring I will bury you, sing this song, I'll carry you
[00:54.20] To your grave, no one can save the softest, son, I look so gray
[00:57.49] People can't remember what you even look like
[01:00.36] You've been gone, gone for way too long
[01:02.28] Deep inside your neighbors' lawn
[01:03.90] Cold case, what a waste
[01:05.36] "C'mon Freddie, have some taste"
[01:06.94] Never, bitch, I do my thing
[01:08.55] I just wanna see you hang
[01:10.34] Runnin' outta anger, I just got to get my fix
[01:13.05] Think I'm nice? Well, what a twist
[01:14.89] Then I go off in the mist
[01:16.85] Eu viajei o mundo todo

lyrics: [00:12.70] Eu viajei o mundo todo
[00:14.77] Olha, puta que pariu
[00:16.40] Primeiro eu passei na 13
[00:17.94] Que é o baile do Brasil
[00:19.70] Eu fui lá pro Jacaré
[00:20.82] Que é o baile de Paris
[00:22.70] Fui parar lá na Colômbia

[00:25.63] Two mo' hoes, bitches cold
[00:27.41] Look, I'm on a roll, .22 magnum water hole
[00:30.33] Aim it close, it's on yo' nose
[00:31.96] It ain't even loaded, I just like to see you scared
[00:34.81] I'm the one to come up to your house and raise your body hair
[00:37.92] What you want from me? The double D, I'll cut you once and let you sleep
[00:41.63] Get so high, I'm 'bout to peak, damn, you love it, lil' freak
[00:44.75] Scopin' in the night, I can barely see a thing
[00:47.62] And I trust my gut to let it buckle, shit, I killed the king
[00:50.87] In the spring I will bury you, sing this song, I'll carry you
[00:54.20] To your grave, no one can save the softest, son, I look so gray
[00:57.49] People can't remember what you even look like
[01:00.36] You've been gone, gone for way too long
[01:02.28] Deep inside your neighbors' lawn
[01:03.90] Cold case, what a waste
[01:05.36] "C'mon Freddie, have some taste"
[01:06.94] Never, bitch, I do my thing
[01:08.55] I just wanna see you hang
[01:10.34] Runnin' outta anger, I just got to get my fix
[01:13.05] Think I'm nice? Well, what a twist
[01:14.89] Then I go off in the mist
[01:16.85] Eu viajei o mundo todo
[01:18.71] Olha, puta que pariu
[01:20.37] Primeiro eu passei na 13
[01:21.83] Que é o baile do Brasil

[00:31.14] Feeding the evil with people like dreams
[00:33.09] Looking straight up and you see the big beam
[00:34.80] Come on and test me I'll kill your whole team

lyrics: [00:12.70] Eu viajei o mundo todo
[00:14.77] Olha, puta que pariu
[00:16.40] Primeiro eu passei na 13
[00:17.94] Que é o baile do Brasil
[00:19.70] Eu fui lá pro Jacaré
[00:20.82] Que é o baile de Paris

[00:25.63] Two mo' hoes, bitches cold
[00:27.41] Look, I'm on a roll, .22 magnum water hole
[00:30.33] Aim it close, it's on yo' nose
[00:31.96] It ain't even loaded, I just like to see you scared
[00:34.81] I'm the one to come up to your house and raise your body hair
[00:37.92] What you want from me? The double D, I'll cut you once and let you sleep
[00:41.63] Get so high, I'm 'bout to peak, damn, you love it, lil' freak
[00:44.75] Scopin' in the night, I can barely see a thing
[00:47.62] And I trust my gut to let it buckle, shit, I killed the king
[00:50.87] In the spring I will bury you, sing this song, I'll carry you
[00:54.20] To your grave, no one can save the softest, son, I look so gray
[00:57.49] People can't remember what you even look like
[01:00.36] You've been gone, gone for way too long
[01:02.28] Deep inside your neighbors' lawn
[01:03.90] Cold case, what a waste
[01:05.36] "C'mon Freddie, have some taste"
[01:06.94] Never, bitch, I do my thing
[01:08.55] I just wanna see you hang
[01:10.34] Runnin' outta anger, I just got to get my fix
[01:13.05] Think I'm nice? Well, what a twist
[01:14.89] Then I go off in the mist
[01:16.85] Eu viajei o mundo todo
[01:18.71] Olha, puta que pariu
[01:20.37] Primeiro eu passei na 13

[00:30.33] Aim it close, it's on yo' nose
[00:31.96] It ain't even loaded, I just like to see you scared
[00:34.81] I'm the one to come up to your house and raise your body hair
[00:37.92] What you want from me? The double D, I'll cut you once and let you sleep
[00:41.63] Get so high, I'm 'bout to peak, damn, you love it, lil' freak
[00:44.75] Scopin' in the night, I can barely see a thing
[00:47.62] And I trust my gut to let it buckle, shit, I killed the king
[00:50.87] In the spring I will bury you, sing this song, I'll carry you
[00:54.20] To your grave, no one can save the softest, son, I look so gray
[00:57.49] People can't remember what you even look like
[01:00.36] You've been gone, gone for way too long
[01:02.28] Deep inside your neighbors' lawn
[01:03.90] Cold case, what a waste
[01:05.36] "C'mon Freddie, have some taste"
[01:06.94] Never, bitch, I do my thing
[01:08.55] I just wanna see you hang
[01:10.34] Runnin' outta anger, I just got to get my fix
[01:13.05] Think I'm nice? Well, what a twist
[01:14.89] Then I go off in the mist
[01:16.85] Eu viajei o mundo todo

[00:16.40] Bitch you know I am the murderous tool
[00:18.34] Freddie gon' kill you right out of his tomb
[00:20.14] Chokin' you out and you hear the big boom
[00:21.86] Devilish shit, choke on a bitch
[00:23.69] Breakin' the skin and finessin' the hit
[00:25.58] Eyes in the back of my head
[00:27.00] Better they dead
[00:27.99] People they call me the Dredd
[00:29.46] I am the darkness, you are a carcass
[00:31.14] Feeding the evil with people like dreams
[00:33.09] Looking straight up and you see the big beam
[00:34.80] Come on and test me I'll kill your whole team
[00:36.53] Ten whole shots to your brain
[00:38.00] Aim it like a gang
[00:38.96] Better cock it back, let it bang
[00:40.29] Bitch you want smoke or the flame?
[00:41.67] Bitch you are a lame
[00:42.79] Bitch you stay out of my lane
[00:44.24] I'mma get dope smokin' deuce
[00:45.90] And if a bitch is crazy I'mma put her on the loose
[00:47.71] Murder shit every day, gotta go away
[00:49.49] Gotta take my time, gotta let Tai-Pei
[00:51.41] I'mma get dope smokin' deuce
[00:53.62] You can see me sippin' on the Goose
[00:55.50] Head laid back, let it loose
[00:57.43] Bitch you know it's alcohol abuse

[00:16.40] Primeiro eu passei na 13
[00:17.94] Que é o baile do Brasil
[00:19.70] Eu fui lá pro Jacaré
[00:20.82] Que é o baile de Paris

[00:25.63] Two mo' hoes, bitches cold
[00:27.41] Look, I'm on a roll, .22 magnum water hole
[00:30.33] Aim it close, it's on yo' nose
[00:31.96] It ain't even loaded, I just like to see you scared
[00:34.81] I'm the one to come up to your house and raise your body hair
[00:37.92] What you want from me? The double D, I'll cut you once and let you sleep
[00:41.63] Get so high, I'm 'bout to peak, damn, you love it, lil' freak
[00:44.75] Scopin' in the night, I can barely see a thing
[00:47.62] And I trust my gut to let it buckle, shit, I killed the king
[00:50.87] In the spring I will bury you, sing this song, I'll carry you
[00:54.20] To your grave, no one can save the softest, son, I look so gray
[00:57.49] People can't remember what you even look like
[01:00.36] You've been gone, gone for way too long
[01:02.28] Deep inside your neighbors' lawn
[01:03.90] Cold case, what a waste
[01:05.36] "C'mon Freddie, have some taste"
[01:06.94] Never, bitch, I do my thing
[01:08.55] I just wanna see you hang
[01:10.34] Runnin' outta anger, I just got to get my fix
[01:13.05] Think I'm nice? Well, what a twist
[01:14.89] Then I go off in the mist
[01:16.85] Eu viajei o mundo todo
[01:18.71] Olha, puta que pariu
[01:20.37] Primeiro eu passei na 13

[00:16.40] Bitch you know I am the murderous tool
[00:18.34] Freddie gon' kill you right out of his tomb
[00:20.14] Chokin' you out and you hear the big boom
[00:21.86] Devilish shit, choke on a bitch
[00:23.69] Breakin' the skin and finessin' the hit
[00:25.58] Eyes in the back of my head
[00:27.00] Better they dead
[00:27.99] People they call me the Dredd
[00:29.46] I am the darkness, you are a carcass
[00:31.14] Feeding the evil with people like dreams
[00:33.09] Looking straight up and you see the big beam
[00:34.80] Come on and test me I'll kill your whole team
[00:36.53] Ten whole shots to your brain
[00:38.00] Aim it like a gang
[00:38.96] Better cock it back, let it bang
[00:40.29] Bitch you want smoke or the flame?
[00:41.67] Bitch you are a lame
[00:42.79] Bitch you stay out of my lane
[00:44.24] I'mma get dope smokin' deuce
[00:45.90] And if a bitch is crazy I'mma put her on the loose
[00:47.71] Murder shit every day, gotta go away
[00:49.49] Gotta take my time, gotta let Tai-Pei
[00:51.41] I'mma get dope smokin' deuce
[00:53.62] You can see me sippin' on the Goose

lyrics: [00:12.70] Eu viajei o mundo todo
[00:14.77] Olha, puta que pariu
[00:16.40] Primeiro eu passei na 13
[00:17.94] Que é o baile do Brasil
[00:19.70] Eu fui lá pro Jacaré
[00:20.82] Que é o baile de Paris

[00:25.63] Two mo' hoes, bitches cold
[00:27.41] Look, I'm on a roll, .22 magnum water hole
[00:30.33] Aim it close, it's on yo' nose
[00:31.96] It ain't even loaded, I just like to see you scared
[00:34.81] I'm the one to come up to your house and raise your body hair
[00:37.92] What you want from me? The double D, I'll cut you once and let you sleep
[00:41.63] Get so high, I'm 'bout to peak, damn, you love it, lil' freak
[00:44.75] Scopin' in the night, I can barely see a thing
[00:47.62] And I trust my gut to let it buckle, shit, I killed the king
[00:50.87] In the spring I will bury you, sing this song, I'll carry you
[00:54.20] To your grave, no one can save the softest, son, I look so gray
[00:57.49] People can't remember what you even look like
[01:00.36] You've been gone, gone for way too long
[01:02.28] Deep inside your neighbors' lawn
[01:03.90] Cold case, what a waste
[01:05.36] "C'mon Freddie, have some taste"
[01:06.94] Never, bitch, I do my thing
[01:08.55] I just wanna see you hang
[01:10.34] Runnin' outta anger, I just got to get my fix
[01:13.05] Think I'm nice? Well, what a twist
[01:14.89] Then I go off in the mist
[01:16.85] Eu viajei o mundo todo
[01:18.71] Olha, puta que pariu
[01:20.37] Primeiro eu passei na 13

[00:25.63] Two mo' hoes, bitches cold
[00:27.41] Look, I'm on a roll, .22 magnum water hole
[00:30.33] Aim it close, it's on yo' nose
[00:31.96] It ain't even loaded, I just like to see you scared
[00:34.81] I'm the one to come up to your house and raise your body hair
[00:37.92] What you want from me? The double D, I'll cut you once and let you sleep
[00:41.63] Get so high, I'm 'bout to peak, damn, you love it, lil' freak
[00:44.75] Scopin' in the night, I can barely see a thing
[00:47.62] And I trust my gut to let it buckle, shit, I killed the king
[00:50.87] In the spring I will bury you, sing this song, I'll carry you
[00:54.20] To your grave, no one can save the softest, son, I look so gray
[00:57.49] People can't remember what you even look like
[01:00.36] You've been gone, gone for way too long
[01:02.28] Deep inside your neighbors' lawn
[01:03.90] Cold case, what a waste
[01:05.36] "C'mon Freddie, have some taste"
[01:06.94] Never, bitch, I do my thing
[01:08.55] I just wanna see you hang
[01:10.34] Runnin' outta anger, I just got to get my fix
[01:13.05] Think I'm nice? Well, what a twist
[01:14.89] Then I go off in the mist
[01:16.85] Eu viajei o mundo todo
[01:18.71] Olha, puta que pariu
[01:20.37] Primeiro eu passei na 13

[00:25.63] Two mo' hoes, bitches cold
[00:27.41] Look, I'm on a roll, .22 magnum water hole
[00:30.33] Aim it close, it's on yo' nose
[00:31.96] It ain't even loaded, I just like to see you scared
[00:34.81] I'm the one to come up to your house and raise your body hair
[00:37.92] What you want from me? The double D, I'll cut you once and let you sleep
[00:41.63] Get so high, I'm 'bout to peak, damn, you love it, lil' freak
[00:44.75] Scopin' in the night, I can barely see a thing
[00:47.62] And I trust my gut to let it buckle, shit, I killed the king
[00:50.87] In the spring I will bury you, sing this song, I'll carry you
[00:54.20] To your grave, no one can save the softest, son, I look so gray
[00:57.49] People can't remember what you even look like
[01:00.36] You've been gone, gone for way too long
[01:02.28] Deep inside your neighbors' lawn
[01:03.90] Cold case, what a waste
[01:05.36] "C'mon Freddie, have some taste"
[01:06.94] Never, bitch, I do my thing
[01:08.55] I just wanna see you hang
[01:10.34] Runnin' outta anger, I just got to get my fix
[01:13.05] Think I'm nice? Well, what a twist
[01:14.89] Then I go off in the mist
[01:16.85] Eu viajei o mundo todo
[01:18.71] Olha, puta que pariu

lyrics: [00:14.45] Killin' the masses, killin' the fool
[00:16.40] Bitch you know I am the murderous tool
[00:18.34] Freddie gon' kill you right out of his tomb
[00:20.14] Chokin' you out and you hear the big boom
[00:21.86] Devilish shit, choke on a bitch
[00:23.69] Breakin' the skin and finessin' the hit
[00:25.58] Eyes in the back of my head
[00:27.00] Better they dead
[00:27.99] People they call me the Dredd
[00:29.46] I am the darkness, you are a carcass
[00:31.14] Feeding the evil with people like dreams
[00:33.09] Looking straight up and you see the big beam
[00:34.80] Come on and test me I'll kill your whole team
[00:36.53] Ten whole shots to your brain
[00:38.00] Aim it like a gang
[00:38.96] Better cock it back, let it bang
[00:40.29] Bitch you want smoke or the flame?
[00:41.67] Bitch you are a lame
[00:42.79] Bitch you stay out of my lane
[00:44.24] I'mma get dope smokin' deuce
[00:45.90] And if a bitch is crazy I'mma put her on the loose
[00:47.71] Murder shit every day, gotta go away
[00:49.49] Gotta take my time, gotta let Tai-Pei
[00:51.41] I'mma get dope smokin' deuce
[00:53.62] You can see me sippin' on the Goose
[00:55.50] Head laid back, let it loose
[00:57.43] Bitch you know it's alcohol abuse
[00:59.05] I'mma get dope smokin' deuce
[01:00.90] You can see me sippin' on the Goose
[01:02.72] Head laid back, let it loose

[00:16.40] Primeiro eu passei na 13
[00:17.94] Que é o baile do Brasil
[00:19.70] Eu fui lá pro Jacaré

[00:25.63] Two mo' hoes, bitches cold
[00:27.41] Look, I'm on a roll, .22 magnum water hole
[00:30.33] Aim it close, it's on yo' nose
[00:31.96] It ain't even loaded, I just like to see you scared
[00:34.81] I'm the one to come up to your house and raise your body hair
[00:37.92] What you want from me? The double D, I'll cut you once and let you sleep
[00:41.63] Get so high, I'm 'bout to peak, damn, you love it, lil' freak
[00:44.75] Scopin' in the night, I can barely see a thing
[00:47.62] And I trust my gut to let it buckle, shit, I killed the king
[00:50.87] In the spring I will bury you, sing this song, I'll carry you
[00:54.20] To your grave, no one can save the softest, son, I look so gray
[00:57.49] People can't remember what you even look like
[01:00.36] You've been gone, gone for way too long
[01:02.28] Deep inside your neighbors' lawn
[01:03.90] Cold case, what a waste
[01:05.36] "C'mon Freddie, have some taste"
[01:06.94] Never, bitch, I do my thing
[01:08.55] I just wanna see you hang
[01:10.34] Runnin' outta anger, I just got to get my fix
[01:13.05] Think I'm nice? Well, what a twist
[01:14.89] Then I go off in the mist
[01:16.85] Eu viajei o mundo todo

[00:25.63] Two mo' hoes, bitches cold
[00:27.41] Look, I'm on a roll, .22 magnum water hole
[00:30.33] Aim it close, it's on yo' nose
[00:31.96] It ain't even loaded, I just like to see you scared
[00:34.81] I'm the one to come up to your house and raise your body hair
[00:37.92] What you want from me? The double D, I'll cut you once and let you sleep
[00:41.63] Get so high, I'm 'bout to peak, damn, you love it, lil' freak
[00:44.75] Scopin' in the night, I can barely see a thing
[00:47.62] And I trust my gut to let it buckle, shit, I killed the king
[00:50.87] In the spring I will bury you, sing this song, I'll carry you
[00:54.20] To your grave, no one can save the softest, son, I look so gray
[00:57.49] People can't remember what you even look like
[01:00.36] You've been gone, gone for way too long
[01:02.28] Deep inside your neighbors' lawn
[01:03.90] Cold case, what a waste
[01:05.36] "C'mon Freddie, have some taste"
[01:06.94] Never, bitch, I do my thing
[01:08.55] I just wanna see you hang
[01:10.34] Runnin' outta anger, I just got to get my fix
[01:13.05] Think I'm nice? Well, what a twist
[01:14.89] Then I go off in the mist

[00:04.17] A caballo vamos pal monte
[00:07.73] A caballo vamos pal mon-
[00:14.16] I been waitin' for this shit
[00:15.51] Freddie comin' up your bitch
[00:17.58] I'm a bumpin' mothafucka with the shit who undercover
[00:20.84] See me once
[00:22.16] I'll kill you beat the price
[00:23.86] I'll fill you with the Gat, take a stack
[00:26.21] Learn a lesson, never lack
[00:27.89] You's a nobody but you wanna hang with Double-D
[00:31.23] Trappin' in the damn streets
[00:33.23] You think you harder, deal with me
[00:34.98] I been sayin' this forever, why you think I'm changin' up?
[00:38.52] I been doing all this dirt while all these bitches wanna run
[00:41.94] I think you should go and quit all of those stupid drugs you do
[00:45.65] And maybe save a little money on the gold, you actin' funny
[00:48.93] You can go ahead and steal my sound until your body reach the ground
[00:52.90] And everything you do will be a joke, go and fuckin' choke
[00:57.39] I ain't lettin' bitches rip me off no mo'
[01:00.70] You got your own brain, better start to use it hoe
[01:04.37] I ain't lettin' bitches rip me off no mo'
[01:07.06] You got your own brain, better start to use it hoe
[01:11.54] I ain't lettin' bitches rip me off no mo'
[01:14.14] You got your own brain, better start to use it hoe
[01:18.54] I ain't lettin' bitches rip me off no mo'
[01:21.53] You got your own brain, better start to use it hoe
